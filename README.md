# Molecule API

![jitpack] ![release]  ![issues] ![license]  ![download]

MoleculeAPI is a spigot resource designed to provide plugin developers with a powerful suite
of tools that streamline their coding process, providing them with some fundamental components, such as an Updater, a
feature packed
console logger, localization, user management and so much more.

We're constantly working on expanding this project, mainly focused on spigot/paper but will eventually expand to provide
support for other
frameworks such as Sponge, Velocity, etc.

## Features

Currently, this API is under constant development, therefore, we're constantly adding new features within it, but as of now these are the features it currently supports
* Feature packed updater
* Enhanced console logging
* Easy Localization

### Upcoming Features
* Enhanced Configurations
* User Management System

Please take a look at our [Documentation](https://docs.moleculepowered.com) for detailed tutorials on how to use each of
these features.
