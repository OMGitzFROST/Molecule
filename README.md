## Open Source&#x20;

Molecule started as a compilation of components frequently used by its developers but has evolved to a power-packed library with a vast variety of molecules used by thousands of other developers, just like you!&#x20;

And now, it is maintained by both the original developers and continuously improved upon by the best community Minecraft has to offer. Frequently adding new molecules, patches, and general improvements, making this API better. We believe in providing a valuable service to our community before operating based on profit and therefore, we do not put our products behind a paywall. Although we don't charge to use this library, if you are happy with our products and team, and still want to show support, feel free to send donations our way as they do help us provide bigger and better products
